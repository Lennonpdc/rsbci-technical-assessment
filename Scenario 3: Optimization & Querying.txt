Scenario 3: Optimization & Querying

Your project assignments table has millions of rows. The query:
`ProjectAssignment::where('employee_id', $employeeId)-
>get();` is slow.

1. Suggest two database optimizations.
`CREATE INDEX idx_employee_id ON project_assignments(employee_id);`
    -Add index on employee_id for a faster filtering


2. Rewrite the query in Eloquent with proper eager loading of the related project.
`$assignments = ProjectAssignment::with('project')
    ->where('employee_id', $employeeId)
    ->get();`



3. Explain how you would confirm the optimization worked (tools or queries to check).
